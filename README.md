# circRNA Detection Workflow

This repository provides code and instructions for detecting circular RNAs (circRNAs) in RNA sequencing data, with the end goal of comparing the accuracy and the computational complexity for each tools. CircRNAs are a type of non-coding RNA that form a closed loop, and have been implicated in various biological processes and diseases.
